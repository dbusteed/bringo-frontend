# bringo frontend
### (to be used with [bringo-backend](https://github.com/dbusteed/bringo-backend))

## quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/dbusteed/bringo-frontend
cd bringo-frontend
npm i
npm start
```

make sure the backend is also running (see above link), then open up `localhost:3000`. the backend repo gives steps for loading some dummy data to start working with, or you can just create a new account and make your own bingo boards

## other
this was my first time making something with React + Django Rest Framework, so things are kinda messy
